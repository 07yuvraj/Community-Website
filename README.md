Being from tier-2 and tier-3 colleges, you often face the problem of knowledge gap in our college days. But once you begin walking in the path of tech, you discover a place where people are just like you. 😇✨ 
We are a group of HITK students trying to fill the knowledge gap and help you find your place of discovery by sharing you the opportunities and resources at the right time!⏱️<br />

This project aims to build the official site for the community page so that any student can use the resources shared by us.
